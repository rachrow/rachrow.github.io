<h2>LinkedIn</h2>

<p>I created our company LinkedIn page, and helped with the design, formatting, postings, and sharing relevant articles. I wrote company blog posts that we shared on our page as well. We gained a few hundred followers after I promoted the page on social media. In addition, I managed a few LinkedIn ad campaigns where we promoted our blog posts. I ran the campaign, watched growth, and talked with my boss about the benefits and drawbacks. I enjoyed watching the analytics on it all!</p>

<h2>MailChimp</h2>

<p>I have a lot of experience with MailChimp. We sent our monthly company newsletters to our 1,000+ college staff, informing them on corporate updates, marketing campaigns, new campuses we were launching at, as well as contest winners. I designed the entire newsletter, and also created all the content. I made sure they had a fluid, pleasing design that worked on desktop and mobile and had all the relevant information. I would monitor the analytics as well, including how many opened the newsletter, what links they clicked on, and if anyone unsubscribed.</p>

<h2>Google Drive</h2>

<p>At this point, I am nearly an expert when it comes to Google Drive. I use it for 95% of my work. I have extensive spreadsheets, use docs every day, share work with coworkers, and created forms for various questionnaires and information we needed to collect for clients. If it is on Google Drive, I can do it.</p>

<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>I have completed the HTML & CSS course from General Assembly. I learned how to build a website completely from scratch, focusing on HTML & CSS design. I learned design elements, basic web building, HTML emails, responsive design, and a ton of other skills. I really loved the course and the skills I learned. </p>

<h2>Writing Skills</h2>

<p>I have great writing skills, both professionally and creatively. I created the content for our Company Brand Book, which we sent to all our marketing hires, and retooled our HR Manual and Guerrilla Marketing Manual. I have also written company blog posts, newsletters, and have fiction experience as well.</p>
